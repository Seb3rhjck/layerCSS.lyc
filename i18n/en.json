  "introduction-description": "<strong>What is LayerCSS?</strong> LayerCSS is a design language based on CSS that introduces advanced features to facilitate the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable styles.",
  "introduction-quote": "Modularity: Divide your styles into logical sections.<br>Reusability: Define values once and use them in multiple places.<br>Ease of Maintenance: Change a value in one place and affect the entire project.",
  "introduction-creator": "<em>Creator:</em> Sebastián (Balthier) Ordoñez Arias, an amateur programmer with basic knowledge in web design and application development.",
  "lyc-title": "2. What is .lyc?",
  "lyc-description": "The `.lyc` file format is the core of LayerCSS. It extends traditional CSS by introducing new syntax and features that make styling more intuitive and efficient.",
  "lyc-feature-syntax": "<strong>Syntax:</strong> Similar to CSS but with added features like variables, nesting, and layers.",
  "lyc-feature-modularity": "<strong>Modularity:</strong> Organize your styles into reusable components.",
  "lyc-feature-compilation": "<strong>Compilation:</strong> `.lyc` files are compiled into standard CSS for browser compatibility.",

  "feature-global-variables": "<strong>Global and Local Variables:</strong> Define reusable values like colors and font sizes.",
  "feature-nested-blocks": "<strong>Nested Blocks:</strong> Write styles hierarchically for better readability.",
  "feature-layers": "<strong>Layers (@layer):</strong> Organize styles into logical sections.",
  "feature-comments": "<strong>Structured Comments:</strong> Use single-line and multi-line comments for documentation.",
  "feature-animations": "<strong>Animations and Keyframes:</strong> Simplify dynamic visual effects.",
  "example-title": "4. Detailed Example",
  "example-description": "Below is a basic example of a `.lyc` file with detailed comments explaining each part of the code. This file uses the fundamental features of LYC: <strong>global variables</strong>, <strong>`calc()`</strong>, <strong>mixins (`@mixin` and `@include`)</strong>, and <strong>inheritance with `@extend`</strong>.",
