  "introduction-title": "Introduction",
  "introduction-description": "<strong>What is LayerCSS?</strong> LayerCSS is a design language based on CSS that introduces advanced features to facilitate the creation of modular, reusable, and maintainable styles.",
  "introduction-quote": "Modularity: Divide your styles into logical sections.<br>Reusability: Define values once and use them in multiple places.<br>Ease of Maintenance: Change a value in one place and affect the entire project.",
  "introduction-creator": "<em>Creator:</em> Sebastián (Balthier) Ordoñez Arias, an amateur programmer with basic knowledge in web design and application development.",
  "lyc-title": "What is .lyc?",
  "lyc-description": "The `.lyc` file format is the core of LayerCSS. It extends traditional CSS by introducing new syntax and features that make styling more intuitive and efficient.",
  "lyc-feature-syntax": "<strong>Syntax:</strong> Similar to CSS but with added features like variables, nesting, and layers.",
  "lyc-feature-modularity": "<strong>Modularity:</strong> Organize your styles into reusable components.",
  "lyc-feature-compilation": "<strong>Compilation:</strong> `.lyc` files are compiled into standard CSS for browser compatibility.",

  "feature-global-variables": "<strong>Global and Local Variables:</strong> Define reusable values like colors and font sizes.",
  "feature-nested-blocks": "<strong>Nested Blocks:</strong> Write styles hierarchically for better readability.",
  "feature-layers": "<strong>Layers (@layer):</strong> Organize styles into logical sections.",
  "feature-comments": "<strong>Structured Comments:</strong> Use single-line and multi-line comments for documentation.",
  "feature-animations": "<strong>Animations and Keyframes:</strong> Simplify dynamic visual effects.",
  "example-title": "Detailed Example",
  "example-description": "Below is a basic example of a `.lyc` file with detailed comments explaining each part of the code. This file uses the fundamental features of LYC: <strong>global variables</strong>, <strong>`calc()`</strong>, <strong>mixins (`@mixin` and `@include`)</strong>, and <strong>inheritance with `@extend`</strong>.",

  "current-process-description": "So far, we have implemented a partial preprocessor or interpreter for the LYC language. This preprocessor performs the following tasks:",
  "current-process-feature-vars": "Variable Replacement: Processes global and local variables (using var(--name)).",

  "current-process-feature-local-scope": "Local Scopes: Local variables are stored in a stack and do not appear in the output file.",
  "current-process-note": "However, this is only a partial compiler, as there are still several important stages of the compilation process yet to be implemented.",
  "compiler-stages-title": "What Will Be Added",
  "compiler-stages-description": "To turn our preprocessor into a complete compiler, we need to add the following features:",
  "compiler-stages-subtitle": "A. Stages of a Complete Compiler",
  "compiler-stage-lexing": "Lexical Analysis (Lexing): Converts source code into tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.).",
  "compiler-stage-parsing": "Syntactic Analysis (Parsing): Builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens generated by the lexer.",
  "compiler-stage-semantic": "Semantic Analysis: Verifies that the AST is valid according to the language rules.",
  "compiler-stage-intermediate-code": "Intermediate Code Generation: Translates the AST into an intermediate format that is easier to optimize or compile.",
  "compiler-stage-optimization": "Optimization: Improves the intermediate code to make it more efficient.",
  "compiler-stage-final-code": "Final Code Generation: Produces the output file in the desired format (in this case, CSS).",
  "additional-features-title": "B. Additional Features That Can Be Added",
  "additional-features-description": "In addition to the compiler stages, we can add the following specific features for LYC:",
  "additional-feature-functions": "Support for Advanced Functions: Implement custom functions in LYC, such as darken(color, percentage) or lighten(color, percentage).",
  "additional-feature-nested-rules": "Advanced Nested Rules: Allow more complex nested CSS rules, similar to those found in SASS or LESS.",
  "additional-feature-strict-mode": "Strict Mode: Add a strict mode that detects potential errors, such as unused variables or duplicate rules.",
  "additional-feature-tools-integration": "Compatibility with External Tools: Integrate LYC with tools like PostCSS or Autoprefixer to improve browser compatibility.",
  "additional-feature-minification": "Automatic Minification: Add an option to automatically generate minified CSS.",
  "additional-feature-debugging": "Debugging: Include comments in the generated CSS to facilitate debugging.",
  "additional-feature-documentation": "Documentation and Examples: Create detailed documentation for LYC and provide usage examples.",
